                    <p> My family and I went to Nanaimo during the summer vacation and visited some friends while we were there. After touring Nanaimo, we stayed at our friend's house for a night. The next day, we went to a nearby dock in Nanaimo, and while looking for parking, we accidentally stumbled upon a whale watching center. I was very excited because it was my first time riding a small yacht. The tour guide skillfully drove the fast yacht, and the strong wind and sea spray made it hard for me to keep my eyes open. I thought it was definitely more thrilling than a roller coaster.</p>
                    <p> Once we reached the viewing spot, we saw three whales. They were smaller than I had imagined, so they probably weren't the type of whales I had in mind. During the trip, we were lucky enough to see two of the whales swim beneath our boat, allowing me to observe them up close.</p>
                    <p> The image on the left is a photo I snapped after a whale did a flip. I chose this picture to showcase the beauty of the whale.</p>
