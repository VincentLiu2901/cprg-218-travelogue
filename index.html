                    <p> My family and I went to Nanaimo during the summer vacation and visited some friends while we were there. After touring Nanaimo, we stayed at our friend's house for a night. The next day, we went to a nearby dock in Nanaimo, and while looking for parking, we accidentally stumbled upon a whale watching center. I was very excited because it was my first time riding a small yacht. The tour guide skillfully drove the fast yacht, and the strong wind and sea spray made it hard for me to keep my eyes open. I thought it was definitely more thrilling than a roller coaster.</p>
                    <p> Once we reached the viewing spot, we saw three whales. They were smaller than I had imagined, so they probably weren't the type of whales I had in mind. During the trip, we were lucky enough to see two of the whales swim beneath our boat, allowing me to observe them up close.</p>
                    <p> The image on the left is a photo I snapped after a whale did a flip. I chose this picture to showcase the beauty of the whale.</p>

                    <p>We rented a car and headed to Vancouver. We visited the downtown malls, the UX museum, and many other places, but my absolute favorite was definitely the coastal cycling. The rented bikes were quite professional, so I was able to ride uphill quickly.</p>
                    <p>After cycling for a while, we reached the base of the Lions Gate Bridge. It was my first time seeing such an impressive structure, and the feeling was something that couldn’t be captured on a phone. Although the photo didn’t do justice to the grandeur of the bridge, it remains an unforgettable memory in my mind.</p>

                    <p>After enjoying a seafood feast, we set off for Vancouver Island by ferry. After taking many photos of the ocean and the boats, we successfully arrived at Victoria Island. We first took a red double-decker sightseeing bus to visit some of the main attractions. We were very glad to have discovered this bus, as it saved us a lot of time.</p>
                    <p>After checking into the hotel, we hiked to a park resembling a pier, Causeway Marina. It was such a romantic place. Many tourists, like myself, gathered there to watch a seaside circus performance. After watching for a while, I decided to donate some money because the performer was truly amazing.</p>
                    <p>As the sun set, the weather began to cool down, but at the same time, the surrounding lights began to glow. At that moment, I saw another side of the scenery, which led me to snap dozens of extra photos.</p>
                    <p>Overall, the trip was very smooth. I successfully visited three cities in one week and saw almost all of the major attractions. This trip left me with a strong desire to visit Vancouver again.</p>
